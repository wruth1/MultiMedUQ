The point of our package is to allow users to do mediation analysis with random effects/multilevel models. To this end, it is convenient for me if the user specifies which random effects they have included. This is done by passing an object called `which_REs`.

Available random effects are:

* `Y.Int`: Intercept for Y
* `Y.X`: Slope for X in Y
* `Y.M`: Slope for M in Y
* `M.Int`: Intercept for M
* `M.X`: Slope for M

Additionally, the following shortcuts are available

* `all`: All REs
* `Y.all`: All REs for Y
* `M.all`: All REs for M
